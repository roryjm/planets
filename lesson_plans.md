# Future Learning
___
This document serves as a repository where I can list all of the coding and computational skills I want to develop, along with links to useful documentation and tutorials.

## Languages
* [*reStructuredText*](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/)
* [*LaTeX*](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
* *Markdown*
* [*YAML*](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/)
	* I've seen this used for creating environment docs for various git projects

# Packages
* [*SPHINX*](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html)
	* SPHINX will be useful when putting together doc folders in project repositories
	* Might be good idea to read up on *reStructuredText* (see above) before trying to implement SPHINX
